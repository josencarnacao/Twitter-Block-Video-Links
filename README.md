I went to Bing and using CoPilot by Microsoft I made the querie:

â€” Make me a Tampermonkey script that will block opening a new tab or exiting Twitter if a video with link is clicked.

And it spewed:

Sure, hereâ€™s a basic Tampermonkey script that should prevent opening a new tab when clicking on a video link on Twitter. This script works by intercepting click events on video elements and preventing their default action.

Please note that this script might not work perfectly for all video links, especially if Twitter changes its website structure or if the videos are embedded in a different way. Always test scripts in a safe environment before using them regularly.

// Look for the code inside the [ Twitter Block Video Links v0.1.js ] file

Remember to install this script through your Tampermonkey dashboard, and ensure that Tampermonkey is enabled when you want this functionality. Let me know if you need help with anything else! ðŸ˜Š
